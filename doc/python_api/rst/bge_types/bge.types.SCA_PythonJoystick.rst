SCA_PythonJoystick(EXP_PyObjectPlus)
====================================

base class --- :class:`EXP_PyObjectPlus`

.. class:: SCA_PythonJoystick(EXP_PyObjectPlus)

   A Python interface to a joystick.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name assigned to the joystick by the operating system. (read-only)

      :type: string

   .. attribute:: activeButtons

      A list of active button values. (read-only)

      :type: list

   .. attribute:: axisValues

      The state of the joysticks axis as a list of values :data:`numAxis` long. (read-only).

      :type: list of ints.

      Each specifying the value of an axis between -1.0 and 1.0
      depending on how far the axis is pushed, 0 for nothing.
      The first 2 values are used by most joysticks and gamepads for directional control.
      3rd and 4th values are only on some joysticks and can be used for arbitary controls.

      * left:[-1.0, 0.0, ...]
      * right:[1.0, 0.0, ...]
      * up:[0.0, -1.0, ...]
      * down:[0.0, 1.0, ...]

   .. attribute:: hatValues (Deprecated. Use :data:`activeButtons` instead)

      The state of the joysticks hats as a list of values :data:`numHats` long. (read-only).

      :type: list of ints

      Each specifying the direction of the hat from 1 to 12, 0 when inactive.

      Hat directions are as follows...

      * 0:None
      * 1:Up
      * 2:Right
      * 4:Down
      * 8:Left
      * 3:Up - Right
      * 6:Down - Right
      * 12:Down - Left
      * 9:Up - Left

   .. attribute:: numAxis

      The number of axes for the joystick at this index. (read-only).

      :type: integer

   .. attribute:: numButtons

      The number of buttons for the joystick at this index. (read-only).

      :type: integer

   .. attribute:: numHats (Deprecated. Use :data:`numButtons` instead)

      The number of hats for the joystick at this index. (read-only).

      :type: integer
      
   .. method:: startVibration()

   Starts the vibration.

   :return: None

.. method:: stopVibration()

   Stops the vibration.

   :return: None

.. attribute:: strengthLeft

   Strength of the Low frequency joystick's motor (placed at left position usually).

   :type: float (0.0 to 1.0)

.. attribute:: strengthRight

   Strength of the High frequency joystick's motor (placed at right position usually).

   :type: float (0.0 to 1.0)

.. attribute:: duration

   Duration of the vibration in milliseconds.

   :type: integer (0 to infinite)

.. attribute:: isVibrating

   Check status of joystick vibration

   :type: bool (true vibrating and false stopped)

.. attribute:: hasVibration

   Check if the joystick supports vibration

   :type: bool (true supported and false not supported)
